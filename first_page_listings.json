Although we do have a physical warehouse space, 90% of our sales are online with customers never setting foot in our dealership. Online auto sales is a rapidly growing business segment with more and more customers preferring to buy their cars fully online. Selling cars online also allows us to keep overhead low and operations simple. Customers buy from us sight-unseen from all over the world because of our 20+ year old eBay account with an impeccable 100% feedback rating and over five hundred five star reviews. When customers see that we have been a Top Rated eBay dealer since 2003, they have full confidence that the vehicle they receive will be just as described. To further differentiate the business, our cars are sold at around 30% below retail value due to the fact that they have \u201crebuilt\u201d branded title (meaning cars were repaired from previous accidents or water damage). We don't repair any cars ourselves, instead \u2013 we have a partnership with several body shops and mechanics that deliver cars to us already fully repaired. You never have to go to any car auctions to compete against other dealers for inventory or deal with repairs - as \u201cauction cars\u201d are almost never retail ready. Cars get delivered right to our dealership and our partners stand behind them (if you discover any problem \u2013 they fix it at their expense). With an average inventory of 30-35 cars, the business moves 30-40 percent of its inventory every month. Cars get sold automatically via eBay platform through a very simple process. A customer may email or call with questions, then they will leave a deposit via eBay. Paperwork gets sent to their email to sign electronically. Then, they simply wire the money to our account and we ship the car to them without ever meeting them in person. Seller is very motivated and business is priced at less than 2x of annual net income. Current inventory of 30-35 cars (valued at $600,000-$700,000) is not included. Ad#:2316160",

This listing includes high-quality, barely-used equipment and assets valued at over $200K. Gain immediate competition advantage with an established business name, a fully operational website, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, and all necessary operational structures already in place. Whether you want to expand in the current city or relocate, this business offers the flexibility to fit your vision. With a proven model ready for growth, potential buyers can leverage market opportunities and capitalize on prepared strategies for immediate action. One Sheet (attached) detailing everything included in this outstanding offer! Executive Summary: Capital CleanIt LLC is a rapidly growing, profitable business specializing in trash and recycle bin cleaning services. Operating in the underserved upper Anne Arundel County, MD area, the company enjoys a significant competitive advantage due to the lack of direct competition within a 50-mile radius.  The business has demonstrated exceptional growth in 2024, with a 326.39% increase in revenue and a 425% increase in clients compared to 2023. This report highlights Capital CleanIt financial performance, operational efficiency, and strategic marketing plan, making it a highly attractive investment opportunity. 1. Financial Performance: Strong Revenue Growth: Revenue increased dramatically representing a 326.39% growth. This showcases the high demand for the service and the business's ability to capture market share. High Client Acquisition Rate: The company added 42 new clients in 2024, a remarkable 425% increase compared to 2023. This demonstrates strong market penetration and efficient customer acquisition strategies. Favorable Average Revenue Per Customer: At $35 per customer, Capital CleanIt maintains competitive pricing, allowing for profitability even with relatively low customer acquisition costs. The pricing structure ($50 one-time, $25 monthly, $35 quarterly, $45 semi-annually) is competitive and caters to various client needs. High Job Completion Rate: The 96.43% job completion rate in 2024 demonstrates operational efficiency and reliability. 2. Operational Efficiency: Minimal Overhead: The business operates with a lean structure, having only one employee. This reduces operating costs and increases profit margins. Excellent Equipment Condition: The equipment is in excellent condition and has a useful life expected to exceed six years before any major maintenance is needed thus minimizing future capital expenditure needs. Strategic Location: The focus on upper Anne Arundel County leverages a largely untapped market with minimal competition, increasing revenue potential. 3. Marketing & Sales Strategy: Effective Customer Acquisition: The current customer acquisition cost of $5 per client is very low and indicates efficient marketing. High Customer Retention: A high 98% recurring revenue rate demonstrates strong customer loyalty and retention strategies. Untapped Market Potential: There are no direct competitors within 50 miles, meaning substantial growth potential through increased marketing and expansion of service area. Planned Improvements: The proposed improvements (social media marketing, and additional service offerings) would improve lead generation and client retention. 4. Risks & Opportunities: Risks:  The business's current reliance on a limited geographical area and single employee represent potential risks. Further expansion will require additional capital for marketing and potentially additional staff. Opportunities:  The significant growth achieved in 2024 demonstrates substantial untapped potential within the current service area. Expansion into neighboring areas presents significant opportunities for growth.  Development of additional service offerings (seasonal cleaning, etc.) could further enhance revenue. Ad#:2303647",
