Although we do have a physical warehouse space, 90% of our sales are online with customers never setting foot in our dealership. Online auto sales is a rapidly growing business segment with more and more customers preferring to buy their cars fully online. Selling cars online also allows us to keep overhead low and operations simple. Customers buy from us sight-unseen from all over the world because of our 20+ year old eBay account with an impeccable 100% feedback rating and over five hundred five star reviews. When customers see that we have been a Top Rated eBay dealer since 2003, they have full confidence that the vehicle they receive will be just as described. To further differentiate the business, our cars are sold at around 30% below retail value due to the fact that they have \u201crebuilt\u201d branded title (meaning cars were repaired from previous accidents or water damage). We don't repair any cars ourselves, instead \u2013 we have a partnership with several body shops and mechanics that deliver cars to us already fully repaired. You never have to go to any car auctions to compete against other dealers for inventory or deal with repairs - as \u201cauction cars\u201d are almost never retail ready. Cars get delivered right to our dealership and our partners stand behind them (if you discover any problem \u2013 they fix it at their expense). With an average inventory of 30-35 cars, the business moves 30-40 percent of its inventory every month. Cars get sold automatically via eBay platform through a very simple process. A customer may email or call with questions, then they will leave a deposit via eBay. Paperwork gets sent to their email to sign electronically. Then, they simply wire the money to our account and we ship the car to them without ever meeting them in person. Seller is very motivated and business is priced at less than 2x of annual net income. Current inventory of 30-35 cars (valued at $600,000-$700,000) is not included. Ad#:2316160",
